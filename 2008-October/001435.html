+  * fixed small issue when player joining a full battle as a spectator. Host did not update battle status
+    to match the correct number of spectators (instead the player who just joined was seen as a normal
+    player to outside players, and not as a spectator).
+  * when generating script.txt file, &quot;hostip=&quot; line is now &quot;localhost&quot; if you are hosting a battle. All other
+    players assign your &quot;outside&quot; (internet) IP/address. I am not sure if that is to fix anything or even broke
+    anything?
+  * added &quot;/PART&quot; command
+
+  *** 0.10 (11x08x05) ***
+  * first public release
