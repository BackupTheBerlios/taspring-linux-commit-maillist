-Installation: 	Windows users:
-
-		Simply extract the archive into your spring\ai\ folder and make sure, the following subfolders exist:
-		
-		\ai\aai			-&gt; readme, faq and different logs 
-		\ai\aai\cache		-&gt; map data (metal spots, water, etc)
-		\ai\aai\cfg\map		-&gt; map config files
-		\ai\aai\cfg\mod		-&gt; mod config files
-		\ai\aai\learn\map	-&gt; map learn files
-		\ai\aai\learn\mod	-&gt; mod learn files
-		\ai\aai\log		-&gt; log files 
-
-		\ai\bot-libs\aai.dll 	-&gt; main ai dll
-
-		If one of these folders does not exist, AAI will crash!
-
-		
-		Linux users: 
-
-		AAI will get the path of a writable directory from spring and load/save its files there
-		e.g.  /usr/local/games/taspring 
-
-		Apart from that the structure is the same as for windows users.
-
-
-
-		Please note, that there are hardly any buildtables included in this release. AAI should make better 
-		unit choices after a while. For further information, have a look at the AAI FAQ.
-
-		Furthermore I want to emphasize that there are quite some opportunities to change/improve AAI's way of
-		playing the game. Have a look at the cfg/help/mod.cfg for further information. If you think you created 
-		a cfg file which makes AAI play a certain much better than the default one mail it to me to include it 
-		in future releases.
-
-
-
-License:	Since AAI v0.70 all files have been released under the GPL
-
-
-
-Mod Support:	AAI must know the internal names of the starting units of the different sides (e.g. ARMCOM 
-		and CORCOM for most TA-mods). There are also some constants you may want to play with, so 
-		AAI tries to load the config from a file in the aai subfolder. The name must be the same as 
-		the modname, with &quot;.cfg&quot; extension (e.g. xta_se_v066.cfg for XTA mod). If you are not sure 
-		about the correct filename, just start a game running that mod. AAI will complain about 
-		missing cfg files and put the desired cfg filename in the log files.
-
-		See example.cfg for more information.
-		
-		By default, AAI has cfg files to support the following mods:
-		- XTA
-		- TA:WD 5.65
-		- AA 2.23 Standard
-		- AA 2.23 Forge
-		- Balanced AA
-		- OTA Shiny 5.5
-		- OTA Classic 5.5
-		- BoTA 1.3
-		- KuroTA 0.47
-		- Star Wars 1.0
-		- TLL 1.04
-		- FF 1.19		
-		- Gundam Annihilation 
-		- Expand &amp; Exterminate 0.163
-		- Spring 1944
-		- TA Battle Fleet
-
-
-		
-	!!!	Remember due to updates of these mods the filenames might change as well, so you have	!!!
-	!!!	to rename the mod.cfg file yourself							!!!
-
-
-
-
-Known bugs/	- AAI sometimes suffers from a bug in the pathfinding (units sometimes get stuck when close 
-Limitations:	  to buildings/objects)
-
-		- AAI does not use nukes, antinukes, emp missiles
-
-
-
-Thanks to: 	- Nicklas Marcusson for porting/compiling the linux version of AAI, lots of help with debugging
-		- Yuritch for testing and providing me with improved mod config files, numerous ideas and suggestions
-		  and coding contributions (since AAI v0.83) 
-
-		- TA Spring devs for creating the best open source rts game I know
-
-		- Jelmer 'JC' Cnossen for some functions and a lot of helpful discussions
-
-		- Krogothe for his mex spot algorithm
-
-		- AccidUK for debugging and some coding suggestions
-
-		- Tournesol and Firenu for helping me getting debugging to work
-		
-		- All other testers who are not listed here
-		
-		- All other people who gave some feedback 
-
-		- Brandon Potter for his TBT 12 cfg file
-
-
-
-AAI v0.85	- Added TRANSPORTERS keyword to mod cfg file, works like SCOUTS or ATTACKERS. Note that AAI does not use transporters
-		  yet, but it may be used in future times
-
-		- Redone scout selection, AAI may now use cloaked scouts, reduced GROUND/AIR/SEA/HOVER_SCOUT categories to one 
-		  SCOUT category 
-		
-		-&gt; Due to those changes buildtable version has been bumped to 0.85
-
-		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from building builders under certain conditions (S44 was suffering from this)
-
-
-AAI v0.84	- AAI will remove sectors where it lost all its buildings from base (may add them again at any time later though)
-
-		- Added DONT_BUILD keyword to mod cfg files, it works like SCOUTS or ATTACKERS, units listed after DONT_BUILD will 
-		  not be build by AAI in any case (and will not been taken into account for internal statistics)
-
-		- Completly redone defence building placement (AAI will now take terrain into account as well as already existing 
-		  defences) It should give much better results now especially on maps that dont have rather flat terrain
-		  
-		- AAI will take allied structures into account when looking for rally points for its combat units (helps to
-		  better prevent AAI from blocking allied bases with its units)
-
-		- Different instances of AAI now share several kind of map information (saves ram space) and do not expand to 
-		  sectors occupied by allied AAIs anymore
-
-		- Added ATTACKERS keyword to mod cfg file to force AAI to use specified units as combat units despite all other 
-		  capabilities of the unit (e.g. buildoptions)  (implemented by Yuritch)
-
-		- Resurrectors now may ressurect corpses instead of reclaiming them (however ressurectors chase newly resurrected 
-		  units trying to repair them - needs some work) (implemented by Yuritch)
-
-		- Improved mex and power plant building rules a bit
-
-		- Fixed a few potential crash bugs
-
-
-AAI v0.81	- AAI will upgrade the least effective metal extractors first (only important if a mod has more than two metal 
-		  extractors with different efficiencies)
-
-		- Better prevention from sending builders to potentially dangerous buildsites outside of the main base
-
-
-AAI v0.80	- Improved/tweaked/fixed attack behaviour, AAI will try to withdraw when facing much stronger enemy forces
-
-		- Added attack behaviour for air only mods
-
-		- Added support for different reading/writing paths (only important for linux users)
-
-		- Completly redesigned factory/builder management to support mobile factories and other stuff in the future
-		  (EE hub system is NOT supported though)
-
-		- Extended mod learning about usage of different unit categories with respect to elapsed game time	
-
-		- Reduced unit categories: LAND/SEA/HOVER/AIR_BUILDER are now in the same category 
-					   GROUND/SEA_FACTORY are now in the same category
-		  (slight performace increase and nicer code)
-
-		- Improved mex spot selection (to prevent unnecessary long ways for builders), AAI will now also build better 
-		  extractors (e.g. moho mines) outside the base (according to safety)
-
-		- Improved placement of stationary defences and tweaked selection of them a bit
-
-		- Cleaned up buildtables, removed some old stuff, mod learning filesize decreased
-
-		- Decreased map-learning filesize by removing stationary artillery learning and some other unnecessary stuff
-		  (map-leraning version changed)
-
-		- AAI no longer crashes when one of its units get captured
-
-		- AAI now builds air bases/refuel pads (thx to yuritch for finding the bug)
-
-		- Fixed various issues/bugs that could cause stalling / prevent AAI from building further factories, builders 
-
-		- Fixed a few bugs that could cause erroneus behaviour on water maps as well as a submarine related bug
-	
-		- Fixed lots of crash bugs
-
-		- Fixed a possible memory leak in AAIBuildTable
-
-		- Increased mod learning file version 
-
-
-
-AAI v0.75	- Completly redone attack system: AAI will now attack more elaborately 
-		  (attackers move on if are cleared, bombers returning to base when target destroyed, attack groups now 
-		  retreat under several circumstances, combat groups are guarded by aa units - however it still tends 
-		  to send in streams of attackers - will be adressed in one of the next versions ) Please note that at the 
-		  moment the new attack system does not work with air only mods such as FF at all. AAI will build a base 
-		  as well as combat units and react to the actions of the player but it will not attack in a proper way
-		
-		- Added MAX_ATTACKS statement to mod.cfg which determines the max number of independent attack waves at
-		  the same time (set to 4 by default)
-
-		- Modified artillery sorting in preparation of artillery support in one of the next versions.
-		  Added GROUND_ARTY_RANGE, SEA_ARTY_RANGE and HOVER_ARTY_RANGE statement to mod cfg. These replace the
-		  former MOBILE_ARTY_RANGE statement (it's no longer valid, remove from old cfg files)
-
-		- For linux users: AAI will now store its files in the only writable datadirectory automatically (where 
-		  spring saves all its other files) 
-
-		- AAI now tries to get a safer rally point if combat units are killed en route 
-
-		- Builders now try to flee when attacked 
-
-		- AAI now takes allied buildings into account when expanding its base (to prevent AAI from building within
- 		  the base of someone else)	
-
-		- Improved AAI's building placement at the beginning of the game (buildings will not be spread out 
-		  that much anymore to reduce walking time of commander (thx to Accid_UK for the idea - should have been 
-		  already implemented in 0.70 but has somehow been commented out)   
-
-		- Tweaked economy/factory/defence building placement and selection
-
-		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from building naval power plants
-
-		- Fixed a bug which sometimes caused builders to leave their construction site
-
-		- Fixed a bug that caused AAI to temporarily run out of scouts when requesting several scouts it could 
-		  not build at that time 
-
-		- Fixed a bug that caused serious confusion concerning unit speeds (unfortunately mod learning file 
-		  version had to be changed)
-
-		- Fixed a very rare crashbug in the building placement algorithm
-
-		- Fixed a possible crash bug in the airforce handling (thx to Nicklas Marcusson for reporting it)
-
-
-
-AAI v0.70	- AAI now handles anti air/assault units, bombers and fighters with different groups 
-		  (requires a little bit of learning to work properly)
-
-		- Added new category SUBMARINE_ASSAULT to improve AAI's behaviour on water maps 
-
-		- Added MAX_ANTI_AIR_GROUP_SIZE, MAX_NAVAL_GROUP_SIZE, MAX_SUBMARINE_GROUP_SIZE 
-		  and MAX_ARTY_GROUP_SIZE (not in use yet) statement to mod cfg	
-
-		- Added FAST_UNITS_RATE and HIGH_RANGE_UNITS_RATE statements to mod.cfg
-
-		- Added different sub-groups for air only mods (light, medium, heavy &amp; super heavy air assault)
-
-		- Added a message being displayed from time to time when AAI has not been loaded succesfully
-
-		- Completly new combat unit selection (in theory, aai should react more dynamically to its 
-		  opponent's behaviour - requires some learning to work porperly)
-
-		- Improved/fixed building of stationary defences - only terporary, defence placement will be reworked 
-		  within the next versions (MIN_SECTOR_THREAT statement added to mod.cfg)
-
-		- Idle builders will now try to reclaim wreckages/features in/close to the base
-
-		- Improved unit detection a bit (some bogus weapons like mobile jammers in aa will not be considered 
-		  being combat units anymore, static mobile units (like dragons claw) will be filtered out as well)		 
-		
-		- Improved assistance management e.g. factories will now call assisters both based on buildque length 
-		  and buildtime of single units (thx to accid_uk for his suggestion)
-
-		- Added MIN_ASSISTANCE_BUILDSPEED statement to mod cfg
-
-		- AAI now takes the position of its base into account when placing stationary defences for 
-		  extractors outside of its base
-
-		- New power plant selection (fixed AAI not building pocket fusions in ff) 
-
-		- Fixed a spelling bug when reading cfg files (keyword had been MAX_ASSITANTS instead of MAX_ASSISTANTS)
-		  (thx to Acidd_UK for reporting this bug) 
-
-		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from upgrading metal extractors
-
-		- Fixed a bug that could cause AAI to freeze when builders get stuck
-
-		- Fixed scout spamming bug 
-
-		- Fixed possible buffer overflow when reading cfg files (thx to FizzWizz for reporting)
-
-		- Fixed a bug that crashed the game on small maps when MAX_MEX_DISTANCE was greater than 
-		  map size (e.g. small divide)
-
-		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from rebuilding killed builders
-
-
-AAI v0.63	- AAI now upgrades radars/jammers 
-	
-		- Added MIN_FACTORIES_FOR_RADAR_JAMMER statement to mod cfg
-
-		- Added support for Expand&amp;Exterminate
-
-		- Added support for mods with buildings as starting units (like AATA)
-
-		- Added mod cfg file for BoTA (thx to yuri)
-
-		- Tweaked defence building selection
-	
-		- AAI now prefers armed metal extractors when building far away from its main base
-
-		- Fixed some bugs in the BuildTable (buildtable version changed)
-
-		- Fixed a bug causing the buildmap not to be cleared when a building has been destroyed
-
-		- Fixed a bug concerning speed groups
-
-		- Fixed various crashbugs (big thank you to nicke for helping me finding them)
-
-			
-
-AAI v0.60:	(AAI's folder structure changed as well as all cache/learning files - i heavily recommend deleting old 
-		 AAI versions before installing AAI 0.60)
-	
-		- Experimental water map support, view FAQ for more details
-
-		- Changed buildtable: Hover crafts got their own category (no longer part of ground units) and several
-		  code cleanups to optimize speed
-
-		- AAI remembers which usefulness of different assault categories and orders further combat units based on 
-		  that (i hope this will especially help adjusting the amount of land, hover and sea units aai uses on a 
-		  mixed land/water map) 
-	
-		- Added support for stationary artillery (e.g. berthas) (added MAX_STAT_ARTY statement to mod cfg)
-
-		- Added support for air repair pads (added MAX_AIR_BASE statement to mod cfg)
-		  edit: seems to be broken somehow 
-
-		- Added support for several factories of the same type (added MAX_FACTORIES_PER_TYPE statement to mod cfg)
-
-		- AAI now defends extractors outside its base up to a certain max dinstace with cheap defence buildings
-		  (added MAX_MEX_DEFENCE_DISTANCE statement to mod cfg)		
-
-		- Builder selection improved, AAI now uses closest idle builder
-
-		- AAI now sorts combat units into groups according to their max speed 
-		  (added UNITS_SPEED_SUBGROUPS statement to mod cfg)
-
-		- Improved Air Force handling (added MAX_AIR_GROUP_SIZE, MIN_AIR_SUPPORT_EFFICIENCY statement to mod cfg)
-			
-		- Improved/Fixed several mod cfg files
-
-		- Improved ressource management/AAI will now upgrade extractors to better ones
-
-		- Improved defence building selection
-
-		- Fixed a bug that crashed game right at the start on certain maps (eg. Battle Holmes)
-		  (thx to HiEnergy for reporting this bug)
-
-		- Fixed a few crashbugs
-
-		- Fixed various smaller issues/bugs
-
-		- Extended memory sharing between multiple instances of AAI and fixed a shared memory related crashbug
-		
-
-
-AAI v0.55:	- AAI is now compatible with the modified ai interface of spring 0.70	
-	
-		- Extended map learning files/every mod now creates own map learing files
-
-		- AAI tries not to send builders in setors which turned out to be too dangerous
-

-
-
-
-AAI v0.50:	- Completly new ressource management system (will be further improved in future versions)
-
-		- Buildtable will now be shared by all instances of AAI (this mainly reduces aai's memory usage as well as 
-		  a slight increase in loading time when running more than one aai-player at the same time) 
-
-		- Improved factory/builder request system/modified buildtable, to be able to add support for AATA	
-
-		- Improved radar/jammer placement
-
-		- AAI now builds metal makers and storage buidlings
-	
-		- Added support for metal maps 
-
-		- Added support for air units only mods (e.g. Final Frontier)
-
-		- Added a general.cfg holding information that is used for all mods (e.g. allowing users to adjust how much
-		  cpu-power AAI takes for scouting)
-		
-		- Fixed a bug when AAI stopped building after completing a few buildings
-
-		- Fixed a bug that crashed AAI right at the beginning on certain maps (especially metal maps)
-		  (thx to IMSabbel for reporting this bug)
-
-		- Fixed a few crashbugs
-
-		- Added mod support: Final Frontier, Gundam Annihilation
-
-		  
-
-AAI v0.40:	- Scouting redone
- 
-		- Construction units now assist other builders/factories when needed
-
-		- Added support for mods with more than two sides -&gt; cfg files changed, replace with new ones
-		
-		- Improved building placement (aai now prevents &quot;diagonal rows&quot;), fixed a building placement 
-		  related crashbug as well
-
-		- AAI now uses radar
-
-		- AAI now uses air units
-
-		- Hopefully fixed a bug concerning blocked buildsites
-
-

-		  if there will be any changes in the future newer file versions will be created automatically
-
-		- Fixed various bugs, AAI should be running much more stable now
-
-		- Switched to krogothe's mex spot algorithm
-
-
-AAI v0.20: 	- First released version

-
-		- Improved selection of more expensive units (prevents AAI from building level 2 
-		  units too early (in most cases...))
-
-		- A certain amount of units will be build to counter air units
-
-		- Various minor fixes and code improvements
-
-
-AAI v0.10: 	(internal version)
-
-		- Works with different mods (see config file section for more information)
-		
-		- AI builds a little base 
-
-		- AI builds all kinds of units and tries to attack enemy bases
-
-		- AI learns about important locations in a map on its own 
-		  (and saves results in a learning-file)

+
+Known bugs/	- AAI sometimes suffers from a bug in the pathfinding (units sometimes get stuck when close 
+Limitations:	  to buildings/objects)
+
+		- AAI does not use nukes, antinukes, emp missiles
+
+
+
+Thanks to: 	- Nicklas Marcusson for porting/compiling the linux version of AAI, lots of help with debugging
+		- Yuritch for testing and providing me with improved mod config files, numerous ideas and suggestions
+		  and coding contributions (since AAI v0.83) 
+
+		- TA Spring devs for creating the best open source rts game I know
+
+		- Jelmer 'JC' Cnossen for some functions and a lot of helpful discussions
+
+		- Krogothe for his mex spot algorithm
+
+		- AccidUK for debugging and some coding suggestions
+
+		- Tournesol and Firenu for helping me getting debugging to work
+		
+		- All other testers who are not listed here
+		
+		- All other people who gave some feedback 
+
+		- Brandon Potter for his TBT 12 cfg file
+
+
+AAI v0.853	- Added COST_MULTIPLIER key word to mod cfg file, it allows to override the costs of a unit, e.g. 
+		  COST_MULTIPLIER armzeus 0.5 causes AAI to treat Arm Zeus as if it would cost half as much as it really does
+		  This feature has been requested by Argh to porperly deal with unit squads (building a single unit will provide 
+	          the player with several independent units)
+
+		- Internal code cleaning
+
+AAI v0.85	- Added TRANSPORTERS keyword to mod cfg file, works like SCOUTS or ATTACKERS. Note that AAI does not use transporters
+		  yet, but it may be used in future times
+
+		- Redone scout selection, AAI may now use cloaked scouts, reduced GROUND/AIR/SEA/HOVER_SCOUT categories to one 
+		  SCOUT category 
+		
+		-&gt; Due to those changes buildtable version has been bumped to 0.85
+
+		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from building builders under certain conditions (S44 was suffering from that)
+
+		- AAI will remove sectors where it lost all its buildings from base (may add them again at any time later though)
+
+		- Completly redone defence building placement (AAI will now take terrain into account as well as already existing 
+		  defences) It should give much better results now especially on maps that dont have rather flat terrain
+		  
+		- AAI will take allied structures into account when looking for rally points for its combat units (helps to
+		  better prevent AAI from blocking allied bases with its units)
+
+		- Different instances of AAI now share several kind of map information (saves ram space) and do not expand to 
+		  sectors occupied by allied AAIs anymore
+
+		- Added DONT_BUILD keyword to mod cfg files, it works like SCOUTS or ATTACKERS, units listed after DONT_BUILD will 		  not be build by AAI in any case (and will not been taken into account for internal statistics)			
+
+		- Added ATTACKERS keyword to mod cfg file to force AAI to use specified units as combat units despite all other 
+		  capabilities of the unit (e.g. buildoptions)  (implemented by Yuritch)
+
+		- Resurrectors now may ressurect corpses instead of reclaiming them (however ressurectors chase newly resurrected 
+		  units trying to repair them - needs some work) (implemented by Yuritch)
+
+		- Improved mex and power plant building rules a bit
+
+		- AAI will upgrade the least effective metal extractors first (only important if a mod has more than two metal 
+		  extractors with different efficiencies)
+
+		- Fixed a few potential crash bugs
+
+
+AAI v0.80	- Improved/tweaked/fixed attack behaviour, AAI will try to withdraw when facing much stronger enemy forces
+
+		- Added attack behaviour for air only mods
+
+		- Added support for different reading/writing paths (only important for linux users)
+
+		- Completly redesigned factory/builder management to support mobile factories and other stuff in the future
+		  (EE hub system is NOT supported though)
+
+		- Extended mod learning about usage of different unit categories with respect to elapsed game time	
+
+		- Reduced unit categories: LAND/SEA/HOVER/AIR_BUILDER are now in the same category 
+					   GROUND/SEA_FACTORY are now in the same category
+		  (slight performace increase and nicer code)
+
+		- Improved mex spot selection (to prevent unnecessary long ways for builders), AAI will now also build better 
+		  extractors (e.g. moho mines) outside the base (according to safety)
+
+		- Improved placement of stationary defences and tweaked selection of them a bit
+
+		- Cleaned up buildtables, removed some old stuff, mod learning filesize decreased
+
+		- Decreased map-learning filesize by removing stationary artillery learning and some other unnecessary stuff
+		  (map-leraning version changed)
+
+		- AAI no longer crashes when one of its units get captured
+
+		- AAI now builds air bases/refuel pads (thx to yuritch for finding the bug)
+
+		- Fixed various issues/bugs that could cause stalling / prevent AAI from building further factories, builders 
+
+		- Fixed a few bugs that could cause erroneus behaviour on water maps as well as a submarine related bug
+	
+		- Fixed lots of crash bugs
+
+		- Fixed a possible memory leak in AAIBuildTable
+
+		- Increased mod learning file version 
+
+
+
+AAI v0.75	- Completly redone attack system: AAI will now attack more elaborately 
+		  (attackers move on if are cleared, bombers returning to base when target destroyed, attack groups now 
+		  retreat under several circumstances, combat groups are guarded by aa units - however it still tends 
+		  to send in streams of attackers - will be adressed in one of the next versions ) Please note that at the 
+		  moment the new attack system does not work with air only mods such as FF at all. AAI will build a base 
+		  as well as combat units and react to the actions of the player but it will not attack in a proper way
+		
+		- Added MAX_ATTACKS statement to mod.cfg which determines the max number of independent attack waves at
+		  the same time (set to 4 by default)
+
+		- Modified artillery sorting in preparation of artillery support in one of the next versions.
+		  Added GROUND_ARTY_RANGE, SEA_ARTY_RANGE and HOVER_ARTY_RANGE statement to mod cfg. These replace the
+		  former MOBILE_ARTY_RANGE statement (it's no longer valid, remove from old cfg files)
+
+		- For linux users: AAI will now store its files in the only writable datadirectory automatically (where 
+		  spring saves all its other files) 
+
+		- AAI now tries to get a safer rally point if combat units are killed en route 
+
+		- Builders now try to flee when attacked 
+
+		- AAI now takes allied buildings into account when expanding its base (to prevent AAI from building within
+ 		  the base of someone else)	
+
+		- Improved AAI's building placement at the beginning of the game (buildings will not be spread out 
+		  that much anymore to reduce walking time of commander (thx to Accid_UK for the idea - should have been 
+		  already implemented in 0.70 but has somehow been commented out)   
+
+		- Tweaked economy/factory/defence building placement and selection
+
+		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from building naval power plants
+
+		- Fixed a bug which sometimes caused builders to leave their construction site
+
+		- Fixed a bug that caused AAI to temporarily run out of scouts when requesting several scouts it could 
+		  not build at that time 
+
+		- Fixed a bug that caused serious confusion concerning unit speeds (unfortunately mod learning file 
+		  version had to be changed)
+
+		- Fixed a very rare crashbug in the building placement algorithm
+
+		- Fixed a possible crash bug in the airforce handling (thx to Nicklas Marcusson for reporting it)
+
+
+
+AAI v0.70	- AAI now handles anti air/assault units, bombers and fighters with different groups 
+		  (requires a little bit of learning to work properly)
+
+		- Added new category SUBMARINE_ASSAULT to improve AAI's behaviour on water maps 
+
+		- Added MAX_ANTI_AIR_GROUP_SIZE, MAX_NAVAL_GROUP_SIZE, MAX_SUBMARINE_GROUP_SIZE 
+		  and MAX_ARTY_GROUP_SIZE (not in use yet) statement to mod cfg	
+
+		- Added FAST_UNITS_RATE and HIGH_RANGE_UNITS_RATE statements to mod.cfg
+
+		- Added different sub-groups for air only mods (light, medium, heavy &amp; super heavy air assault)
+
+		- Added a message being displayed from time to time when AAI has not been loaded succesfully
+
+		- Completly new combat unit selection (in theory, aai should react more dynamically to its 
+		  opponent's behaviour - requires some learning to work porperly)
+
+		- Improved/fixed building of stationary defences - only terporary, defence placement will be reworked 
+		  within the next versions (MIN_SECTOR_THREAT statement added to mod.cfg)
+
+		- Idle builders will now try to reclaim wreckages/features in/close to the base
+
+		- Improved unit detection a bit (some bogus weapons like mobile jammers in aa will not be considered 
+		  being combat units anymore, static mobile units (like dragons claw) will be filtered out as well)		 
+		
+		- Improved assistance management e.g. factories will now call assisters both based on buildque length 
+		  and buildtime of single units (thx to accid_uk for his suggestion)
+
+		- Added MIN_ASSISTANCE_BUILDSPEED statement to mod cfg
+
+		- AAI now takes the position of its base into account when placing stationary defences for 
+		  extractors outside of its base
+
+		- New power plant selection (fixed AAI not building pocket fusions in ff) 
+
+		- Fixed a spelling bug when reading cfg files (keyword had been MAX_ASSITANTS instead of MAX_ASSISTANTS)
+		  (thx to Acidd_UK for reporting this bug) 
+
+		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from upgrading metal extractors
+
+		- Fixed a bug that could cause AAI to freeze when builders get stuck
+
+		- Fixed scout spamming bug 
+
+		- Fixed possible buffer overflow when reading cfg files (thx to FizzWizz for reporting)
+
+		- Fixed a bug that crashed the game on small maps when MAX_MEX_DISTANCE was greater than 
+		  map size (e.g. small divide)
+
+		- Fixed a bug that prevented AAI from rebuilding killed builders
+
+
+AAI v0.63	- AAI now upgrades radars/jammers 
+	
+		- Added MIN_FACTORIES_FOR_RADAR_JAMMER statement to mod cfg
+
+		- Added support for Expand&amp;Exterminate
+
+		- Added support for mods with buildings as starting units (like AATA)
+
+		- Added mod cfg file for BoTA (thx to yuri)
+
+		- Tweaked defence building selection
+	
+		- AAI now prefers armed metal extractors when building far away from its main base
+
+		- Fixed some bugs in the BuildTable (buildtable version changed)
+
+		- Fixed a bug causing the buildmap not to be cleared when a building has been destroyed
+
+		- Fixed a bug concerning speed groups
+
+		- Fixed various crashbugs (big thank you to nicke for helping me finding them)
+
+			
+
+AAI v0.60:	(AAI's folder structure changed as well as all cache/learning files - i heavily recommend deleting old 
+		 AAI versions before installing AAI 0.60)
+	
+		- Experimental water map support, view FAQ for more details
+
+		- Changed buildtable: Hover crafts got their own category (no longer part of ground units) and several
+		  code cleanups to optimize speed
+
+		- AAI remembers which usefulness of different assault categories and orders further combat units based on 
+		  that (i hope this will especially help adjusting the amount of land, hover and sea units aai uses on a 
+		  mixed land/water map) 
+	
+		- Added support for stationary artillery (e.g. berthas) (added MAX_STAT_ARTY statement to mod cfg)
+
+		- Added support for air repair pads (added MAX_AIR_BASE statement to mod cfg)
+		  edit: seems to be broken somehow 
+
+		- Added support for several factories of the same type (added MAX_FACTORIES_PER_TYPE statement to mod cfg)
+
+		- AAI now defends extractors outside its base up to a certain max dinstace with cheap defence buildings
+		  (added MAX_MEX_DEFENCE_DISTANCE statement to mod cfg)		
+
+		- Builder selection improved, AAI now uses closest idle builder
+
+		- AAI now sorts combat units into groups according to their max speed 
+		  (added UNITS_SPEED_SUBGROUPS statement to mod cfg)
+
+		- Improved Air Force handling (added MAX_AIR_GROUP_SIZE, MIN_AIR_SUPPORT_EFFICIENCY statement to mod cfg)
+			
+		- Improved/Fixed several mod cfg files
+
+		- Improved ressource management/AAI will now upgrade extractors to better ones
+
+		- Improved defence building selection
+
+		- Fixed a bug that crashed game right at the start on certain maps (eg. Battle Holmes)
+		  (thx to HiEnergy for reporting this bug)
+
+		- Fixed a few crashbugs
+
+		- Fixed various smaller issues/bugs
+
+		- Extended memory sharing between multiple instances of AAI and fixed a shared memory related crashbug
+		
+
+
+AAI v0.55:	- AAI is now compatible with the modified ai interface of spring 0.70	
+	
+		- Extended map learning files/every mod now creates own map learing files
+
+		- AAI tries not to send builders in setors which turned out to be too dangerous
+
+		- Fixed a rounding related crashbug
+
+		- Fixed a bug causing AAI to stop constructing new buidlings
+
+		- Fixed a bug causing AAI to build rows of sensor towers in SW:TA			
+
+		- Fixed several bugs in the energy management causing aai not to build any further power plants
+
+
+
+AAI v0.50:	- Completly new ressource management system (will be further improved in future versions)
+
+		- Buildtable will now be shared by all instances of AAI (this mainly reduces aai's memory usage as well as 
+		  a slight increase in loading time when running more than one aai-player at the same time) 
+
+		- Improved factory/builder request system/modified buildtable, to be able to add support for AATA	
+
+		- Improved radar/jammer placement
+
+		- AAI now builds metal makers and storage buidlings
+	
+		- Added support for metal maps 
+
+		- Added support for air units only mods (e.g. Final Frontier)
+
+		- Added a general.cfg holding information that is used for all mods (e.g. allowing users to adjust how much
+		  cpu-power AAI takes for scouting)
+		
+		- Fixed a bug when AAI stopped building after completing a few buildings
+
+		- Fixed a bug that crashed AAI right at the beginning on certain maps (especially metal maps)
+		  (thx to IMSabbel for reporting this bug)
+
+		- Fixed a few crashbugs
+
+		- Added mod support: Final Frontier, Gundam Annihilation
+
+		  
+
+AAI v0.40:	- Scouting redone
+ 
+		- Construction units now assist other builders/factories when needed
+
+		- Added support for mods with more than two sides -&gt; cfg files changed, replace with new ones
+		
+		- Improved building placement (aai now prevents &quot;diagonal rows&quot;), fixed a building placement 
+		  related crashbug as well
+
+		- AAI now uses radar
+
+		- AAI now uses air units
+
+		- Hopefully fixed a bug concerning blocked buildsites
+
+
+AAI v0.30: 	- AAI now builds defence buildings (will be extended later on)
+
+		- Improved expansion
+	
+		- All learning/cache files now contain an internal version to provide better compatibility in the future. 
+		  if there will be any changes in the future newer file versions will be created automatically
+
+		- Fixed various bugs, AAI should be running much more stable now
+
+		- Switched to krogothe's mex spot algorithm
+
+
+AAI v0.20: 	- First released version
+
+		- Completely rewritten metal/energy management -&gt; still not working very good
+
+		- Improved selection of more expensive units (prevents AAI from building level 2 
+		  units too early (in most cases...))
+
+		- A certain amount of units will be build to counter air units
+
+		- Various minor fixes and code improvements
+
+
+AAI v0.10: 	(internal version)
+
+		- Works with different mods (see config file section for more information)
+		
+		- AI builds a little base 
+
+		- AI builds all kinds of units and tries to attack enemy bases
+
+		- AI learns about important locations in a map on its own 
+		  (and saves results in a learning-file)
+
