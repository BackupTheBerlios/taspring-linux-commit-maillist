 - Added some OGGVorbis sound support.
-- Replacement Bark, bleaf and foam images. 
 - Added behavior to mobile units so that they will start chasing when the target
   is running away, but before the target exits weapons range, allowing the unit
   to fire continuously at the retreating unit, instead of the cycles of firing,
   then running to catch up that existed prevously.

-Unit / Weapon / Feature Definition Tags:
+Modinfo / modrules tags:

+  running long Killed() scripts) can be fired on via modrules.tdf new section:
+    [FIREATDEAD]
+    {
+      fireAtKilled=0;
+      fireAtCrashing=0;
+    }
+  The defaults are to disallow both (Spring 0.75 behaviour, both variables set
+  to 0). Spring 0.74 behaviour (allow both) can be emulated by setting both
+  variables to 1.
+- Added modinfo.tdf 'version', 'mutator', and 'shortName' tags.
+- Added the following to modrules.tdf (default values shown):
+    [DISTANCE] {
+      builderUse2D=0;
+    }
+    [EXPERIENCE] {
+      powerScale=1.0;
+      healthScale=0.7;
+      reloadScale=0.4;
+    }
+- Adds [experience] { experienceMult = 1.0; } to modrules.
+- Adds [flankingBonus] { defaultMode = 1; } to modrules.
+- Replaces the old bonus shield system with flanking bonus
 
+Unit / feature definition tags:
+- The TDF tags MetalStorage and EnergyStorage now override the StartMetal and
+  StartEnergy specified in the startscript, instead of the other way round. If
+  MetalStorage or EnergyStorage isn't specified the default values for commander
+  units are StartMetal and StartEnergy. For other units the default remains 0.
+- Moved the buildOptions definitions into the unitDef definitions, LuaParser
+  handles backwards compatibility.
+- Changed init_cloaked to initcloaked.
+- Add a tag 'pushResistant' to UnitDef. If set to true, a unit will not be
+  pushed out of the way by another when their footprints overlap, nor will
+  it respond to BuggerOff directives when the other party has an important
+  move order. Defaults to false.
+- Added a per-soundfile volume control format for unitdefs
+    sounds = {
+      ok = 'oksound',
+      cancel = {
+        'cancel1',
+        'cancel2',
+      },
+      select = {
+        { file = 'selsound1', volume = 2.0 },
+        { file = 'selsound2', volume = 2.5 },
+        etc...
+      },
+    }
+- Features have new tag &quot;reclaimTime&quot; defining how long they take to reclaim,
+  default is metal+energy.
+- Added tags:
+    transportUnloadMethod = &lt;integer&gt;;  // 0 - land unload, 1 - flyover drop, 2 - land flood
+    fallSpeed = &lt;float&gt;
+    unitFallSpeed = &lt;float&gt;
+  These dictate the speed of units being dropped from the transport.
+  fallSpeed is used on the transports FBI file, to dictate the speed of all
+  units it drops, unitFallSpeed is used on each transported unit to override
+  fallSpeed.
+- Added flighttime functionality to cannons.
+- Added flighttime to bombdroppers.
+- Added FBI tag cantBeTransported=0|1, if set to 1 no transport can load this unit.
+- Added FBI tag minTransportSize=int, determines the smallest size footprint
+  that the transport can load
+- Added FBI tag minTransportMass=float, determines the smallest mass unit that
+  the transport can load.
+- Removed the check for Air movetype for holdSteady FBI tag, so now ground
+  transports can use it too.
+- New FBI tag for transports; float unloadSpread: Controls the spacing between
+  units in an area unload command, works as a multiple, default is 1.
+- Added the 'decloakSpherical' unitDef tag  (defaults to true).
+- Added optional 3D ranging for all builder operations.
+  (build, repair, reclaim, etc...) (per-unitdef buildRange3D=true)
+- New unitDef parameters:
+    int    flankingBonusMode
+    float  flankingBonusMax
+    float  flankingBonusMin
+    float  flankingBonusMobilityAdd
+    float3 flankingBonusDir
+- Added the &quot;canSelfDestruct = true&quot; unitDef tag.
+- Enable CEGs to be tied to pieces of exploding units
+  (CEG replaces the default smoke if used, but not the miniscule fire-effect)
+- Added CEG opcodes y, x, a, p and q. Except for p those operate on a set of 16
+  buffers that store a float value each.
+  y# - Yank: Stores the running value in the buffer # and returns 0.
+  x# - Multiply: Multiplies the value with the contents of buffer #.
+  a# - Add: Adds the contents of buffer #.
+  p# - Pow: Returns the #th power of the value.
+  q# - Buffer Pow: Like Pow but uses the contents of buffer # as the exponent.
+- Add a tag &quot;factoryHeadingTakeoff&quot; (on request of the SWS folks to prevent some
+  clipping issues) which controls the takeoff behavior of TAAirMoveType aircraft.
+  True (default) means planes start matching their factory's heading right after
+  taking off from the pad, false means they maintain the heading of the pad
+  until reaching wantedHeight.
+- Added [CONSTRUCTION] section to Modruless.tdf:
+  constructionDecay (bool, default true): Should constructions decay if noone is working on them?
+  constructionDecayTime (float, default 6.66): How long until the decay starts?
+  constructionDecaySpeed (float, default 0.03): The speed of the decay, 
+  whereby buildTime*decaySpeed = time for a total decay so higher = slower decay
+- Added unit FBI collide tag (boolean, default: 1), currently affects only planes:
+  If set to 0 the plane will not collide with any other unit. Most notably this
+  saves the CPU-heavy collision checks every frame (big performance boost!) and
+  avoids the damage planes normally take from bumping into each other.
+  Projectiles will still collide with the units normally.

+    BounceRebound: (default: 1)
+      Amount of vertical speed keeps and reverses.
+    NumBounce: (default: -1)
+      The number of bounces a weapon will make. -1 indicates no limit.
 - Added the ability to bounce for Torpedos, Missiles, Lasers, Cannons, and Emgs.
-- Added flighttime functionality to cannons.

-- Added FBI tag minTransportSize=int,
-    determines the smallest size footprint that the transport can load
-- Added FBI tag minTransportMass=float,

-- Weapon projectiles can now spawn a CEG at their position every frame using the cegTag weapon tag.
-- ProximityPriority tag - acts as a multiplier for the distance to the target in the priority calculation. Note that negative values make weapons prefer distant targets.
-- Added the following to modrules.tdf (default values shown):
-    [DISTANCE] {
-      builderUse2D=0;

 - Adds three opcodes to the CEG definitions:
- - m (modulo or sawtooth wave) returns the remainder of
-    the runing value divided by m's parameter (100 m24
-    returns 4)
- - s (sine) returns the sine of the running value with
-   the parameter acting as the amplitude
- - k (discrete) returns the running value floored to an
-   integral multiple of the parameter 
-- All weapon projectiles that have a TTL now supply their
-  remaining ttl-value as the damage param to their trail
-  CEG (Flame projectiles use curTime instead).

+- All weapon projectiles that have a TTL now supply their remaining ttl-value as

 - Added alwaysVisible weapon tag, makes the projectile visible, even without LOS.
-- Enable CEGs to be tied to pieces of exploding units
- (CEG replaces the default smoke if used, but not the miniscule fire-effect)
-- added CEG opcodes y, x, a, p and q. Except for p those operate on a set of 16 buffers that store a float value each.
-  y# - Yank: Stores the running value in the buffer # and returns 0.
-  x# - Multiply: Multiplies the value with the contents of buffer #.
-  a# - Add: Adds the contents of buffer #.
-  p# - Pow: Returns the #th power of the value.
-  q# - Buffer Pow: Like Pow but uses the contents of buffer # as the exponent.
-- added the weapon tag leadLimit that limits the maximum distance a unit will lead a target 
-  (default is -1 which means infinite).
-- added the weapon tag leadbonus which is multiplied with the unit's experience and added to the lead limit.
-- added the weapon tag predictBoost (default 0 for non-burnblow, 0.5 for burnblow weapons) which fixes the 
-  &quot;this should be turned into a separate tag&quot; comment in Weapon.cpp. No idea what it does but it doesn't 
-  break anything.
-- Add a tag &quot;factoryHeadingTakeoff&quot; (on request of the SWS
-  folks to prevent some clipping issues) which controls the
-  takeoff behavior of TAAirMoveType aircraft. True (default)
-  means planes start matching their factory's heading right
-  after taking off from the pad, false means they maintain
-  the heading of the pad until reaching wantedHeight. 
-- added [CONSTRUCTION] section to Modruless.tdf:
-  constructionDecay (bool, default true): Should constructions decay if noone is working on them?
-  constructionDecayTime (float, default 6.66): How long until the decay starts?
-  constructionDecaySpeed (float, default 0.03): The speed of the decay, 
-  whereby buildTime*decaySpeed = time for a total decay so higher = slower decay
